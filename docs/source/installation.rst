Installation
===================================

In this section you will be guided in the process of installing/updating Simplicage as an add-on.

Install
--------

The installation of the model should be done through the Blender preferences.

.. note::
    Before proceeding with the installation, `be sure to install the latest Blender version <https://www.blender.org/download/>`_.
    
    In particular, the addon is compatible with Blender 3.2.x or newest versions.
    We can not provide any support for installing Simplicage on earlier versions.

.. note::
    Do not unpack the .zip file before installing the addon. Select directly the file you download.

The steps are the following.

#. Open Blender *Settings*.

If you are updating the add-on, please follow again the guide before. Be sure to restart Blender before using the new version of the add-on.
