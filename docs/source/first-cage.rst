First cage
===================================

In this section we create the first cage with Simplicage.

The quick cage setup requires only a couple of very simple steps:

* Open the *Simplicage* tab (see Installation if the tab is not available)

* In the Simplicage tab, firstly *select the Mesh Object* from which the cage should be generated.

* *Select a bone* of the armature whose Mesh Object is the one selected in the previous step.

* Click on *Create Cage*.
